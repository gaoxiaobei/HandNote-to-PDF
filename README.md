# HandNote-to-PDF

HandNote-to-PDF is an innovative learning tool designed to bridge the gap between paper-based and digital learning. It converts your handwritten notes on printed PDF documents into digital annotations, creating a seamless learning experience.

## Project Overview

In the digital age, many people still prefer taking notes on paper due to its intuitive and flexible nature. However, paper notes are difficult to preserve, share, and retrieve. HandNote-to-PDF is created to solve this problem.

### Core Features

- **Image Preprocessing**: Optimize captured note photos for enhanced image quality
- **Handwriting Recognition**: Accurately extract handwritten content from documents
- **Vectorization**: Convert bitmap notes into crisp vector graphics
- **PDF Integration**: Seamlessly embed processed notes into original PDF documents

## Workflow

1. Print your PDF study materials
2. Make handwritten annotations on the paper
3. Take photos of the annotated documents using your phone
4. Upload the photos to HandNote-to-PDF
5. The program automatically processes and generates a new PDF with digitized notes

## Technical Features

- Advanced image processing algorithms
- Precise handwriting recognition technology
- High-quality vector conversion
